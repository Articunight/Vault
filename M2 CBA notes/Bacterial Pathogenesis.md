##### Kock's postulate
To prove that a particular microorganism can cause a particular disease.
- Microorganism is found in the body in all cases of the disease
- Isolated from diseased case and grown i n a series of pure culture in vitro
- reproduce the disease on the inoculation of a pure culture into a healthy and susceptible animal
- Microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent
##### Fredricks and relman's koch's postulates 
- Nucleic acid sequence belonging to putative pathogen should be present in most cases of an infection disease
- Fewer or no copies of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences should occur in hosts or tissues with disease
- with resolution of disease number of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences should decrease
- When sequence detection predates disease, sequence-disease association is causal
- Nature of microorganism inferred from available sequence, should be consistent with biological characteristic of organisms

##### Bacterial pathogenesis
- Transmission from host to portal of entry
	- Horizontal for human-human
	- Vertical for mother-baby
	- Non-human sources(inanimate and biological)
	- Zoonosis
	- Portals of entry
- Evasion of host defense(skin, RES etc.)
	- Lack in skin continuity
	- *IgA* cleavage
	- Disturbance of secretions
	- Immobility of respiratory cilia
	- pH disturbances
	- Loss of normal flora
	- Antiphagocytic effect of capsule
- Adherence to cell surface
	- By cilia, capsule, glycocalyx
	- CSRs (*adhesins*, *selectins*)
	- Bacterial surface proteins(*curli* in E.coli *M proteins* in streptococci)
	- Presence of foreign bodies(heart valves, catheters etc. that allow bacteria to adhere to them and avoid phagocytosis)
- Invasion
	- Enters cell by pinocytosis, or encourage cell to engulf pathogen
	- Enter cytoplasm by dissolution of vacuolar membrane
	- Utilize enzymes to spread in tissues
	- Penetrate deeper tissues from epithelium into blood, lymph and movement via flagella
- Intra-cellular survival
	- Interaction of *invasin* proteins on bacteria with cell receptors of *integrin* family
	- Protected from antibodies and neutrophils
	- Inhibits phagosome and lysosome fusion
	- Inhibit acidification of phagosome
	- Escape from phagosome
	- Move from one cell to other(actin tunnels/rockets)
	- Obligate intra-cellular parasites are forced to enter cell(*Chlamydia, Rickettsia*)
	- Facultative pathogens can survive extra-cellularly(*Mycobacterium, legionella, brucella, listeria, histoplasma)
- Host response
	- Inflammation
	- Immunity
	- Immunopathogenesis
		- Involves signs and symptoms due to immune response(fever, glomerulonephritis, Antibody reactions with host tissues)
- Progression/Resolution
	- Dependent on host immune response and virulence
	- Latent infection: Persistence of organism permanently(*Herpes*)
- Damage
	- Direct + Specific
	- Direct + non-specific
		- Organ dysfunction
		- Endotoxic shock
		- *MALT lymphomas* in gastric CA
	- Indirect
