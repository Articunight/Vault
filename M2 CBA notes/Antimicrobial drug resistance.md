___
##### Mechanism of action of antimicrobials
- ###### Inhibition of synthesis of
	- Cell wall([[Penicillins]])
	- Protein
	- Nucleic acid
- ###### Alteration of cell membrane function
	- Bacterial 
	- Fungal
- ###### Additional mechanisms
	- Inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis
	- Electron sink accept electrons depriving organism of reducing power

#### Mechanism of mediating bacterial resistance
4 major mechanisms of resistance
- ###### Inactivation of drug
	- Beta lactamase. Cleaves [[Penicillins]] and [[Cephalosporins]]
	- Staphylococci, Gonococci, Enterococci Gram -ve rods
	- *Amidase* is used to convert *pyrazinamide*(Anti-TB). Alteration
	- *Catalase* converts INH(*isoniazid*) to active metabolite
	- MRSA(Failure of autolytic enzymes to activate upon loss of cell wall)
- ###### Synthesis of modified targets
	- *Methylation* of *23S* ribosomal RNA in 50S subunit of ribosome in *Erythromycin* resistance
	- Replacement of *alanine* with lactate in peptidoglycan cell wall *Vancomycin* resistance
	- Mutation in 30S subunit *Streptomycin* resistance
	- Mutation in DNA gyrase *Quinolone* resistance
	- Mutation in RNA polymerase *Rifampin* resistance
	- Alteration of PBP target site of [[Penicillins]] is modified in MRSA
- ###### Reduced permeability to drugs
	- Change in porins([[Penicillins]], [[Aminoglycosides]])
	- Change in outer membrane(Impaired active transport of Amikacin, Quinolone)
- ###### Active export of drug
	- Multidrug-resistance pump(Tetracyclines, [[Cotrimoxazole|Sulfonamides]], Quinolones)
#### Genetic basis of resistance
- ##### Chromosome-mediated resistance
	- Much lower frequency
- ##### Plasmid-mediated resistance
	- More clinically important
	- More common in Gram *-ve rods*
	- 
#### Non-genetic basis of resistance
- ##### Resting state
	- Metabolically inactive state of pathogen. Susceptibility increases with activity.
- ##### Protoplast
	- Insensitive to cell wall inhibitors 
- ##### Abscess cavity
- ##### Intracellular location
- ##### Presence of foreign bodies
