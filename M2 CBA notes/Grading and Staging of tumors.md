___
#### Tumor Staging
Describes size(degree of invasion) and spread of tumor. More clinically significant than grading. Involves radiological and clinical methods.
##### TNM classification
- ###### Tumor size
	Size of tumor from 1-4
	T0 indicates carcinoma in situ
- ###### Node metastasis
	Regional node metastasis, extent of spread to regional lymph nodes 0-3
- ###### Metastasis(distant)
	Sites of metastases 0-1

##### Stages
- ###### Stage 0
	- Cancer is where it started(in situ)
- ###### Stage 1
	- cancer is small and hasn't spread anywhere else
- ###### Stage 2
	- Cancer has grown but hasn't spread
- ###### Stage 3
	- cancer is large and has spread to surrounding tissues
- ###### Stage 4
	- Cancer is large and has spread to distant tissues


##### Methods
Radiological: 
- Initially judged by CT/MRI
Clinical:
- FNAC(fine needle aspiration cytology)
- Needle biopsy is confirmatory generally
Surgical:
- surgical exploration

#### Tumor Grading
Degree of differentiation and mitotic activity on histological examination. Low-grade(well-differentiated) to High-grade(anaplastic).
Basically a comparison between pathological and physiological
