Cultivation refers to the process of growing bacteria in a controlled medium

Energy
Utilizes saccharides, peptides, peptones
for aerobic and anerobic growth
Photosynthesis may also be performed 

#### Physicochemical factors effecting growth
- ##### Temperature(Celsius)
	- Psychrophiles(0-20)
		- Survive in fridge
	- Psychrotrophic
		- (Low temp, cause food poisoning)
	- Mesophiles(20-40) 37 C ideal
	- Thermophiles(40-70)
- ##### Water activity
Water vapor pressure relative to pure water.
Gram +ve organisms can survive desiccation by rehydration while Gram -ve cannot
- Osmophiles
	- Osmotic pressure tolerant
- ##### pH
7.4-7.6 optimum
5-8.5 Range
- Acidophiles
	- Acid tolerant less than pH 5. Lactobacilli
- Halophiles
	- Alkali tolerant

##### Oxygen
Certain bacteria can utilize *superoxide dismutase* to help destroy attack cells
Others can utilize *catalase* to be resistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 
- ###### Aerobes 
	Require oxygen to grow
	- Obligate Aerobes
		- MUST have O<sub>2</sub> to grow i.e. *M. Tuberculosis*
	- Microaerophilic
		- Small requirement for oxygen
- ###### Anaerobes
	Grow in the absence of oxygen, rely on fermentation.
	- Obligate Anaerobes
		- Environment must have no oxygen. Lack SOD and catalase. *Clostridium*
	- Aerotolerant
		- Anaerobes but can survive in Oxygen environment
	- Facultative anaerobes
		- Can grow in presence or absence *E. Coli*
#### Bacterial cultures in lab
- Isolation
	isolate sample from specimen
- Identification
	Demonstrate properties and identify
- Growth
	Obtain enough growth for prep of antigens and other tests
- Typing
	Typing bacterial isolates?
- Sensitivity
	To relevant therapies
- Viable Counts
	Estimation of viable counts
- Maintain
	Maintenance of stock cultures


##### Constituents
- Agar
- Peptones
- NaCl
- pH
- Yeast
- 98C melting point
- 42C freezing point

##### Types of media
###### By state
- Solid media (Agar)
- Liquid media (Broth)
- Semi-solid media
- Firm media (Agar but concentrated to prevent motility)
- Double phase media(Castaneda)

###### By composition
- Simple media
- Enriched media(Blood or Chocolate agar(heated for hemolysis))
- Enrichment broth(Liquid)
	- *Selenite F* or *Tetrathionate* broth
- Selective Media
	- Inhibitory for certain bacteria
	- Usually ensured by antibiotics
	- *Tellurite blood agar*
	- VCNT blood agar(vancomycin, colistin, nystatin, trimethoprim)
- Indicator media
	- Changes color in presence of bacterial growth
	- *Bismuth Sulphite Agar*
###### By functionality
- Differential media
	- Differentiates different organisms
	- *McConkey agar, CLED agar
	- *TCBS agar* (Thiosulfate, citrate, bile, sucrose)
- Transport media
	- Prevents deterioration of organism during transport
	- *Cary blair, Stuart, Amies*
- Composite media
	- Identifies isolates
	- *Triple sugar iron* checks for certain sugars(e.g. lactose)
