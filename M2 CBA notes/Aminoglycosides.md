___
#### Aminoglycosides(5)
Gentamicin(topical), *Neomycin*(topical generally), Amikacin, Tobramycin, *Streptomycin*
GNATS
Negligible protein binding except *Streptomycin*
Minimal metabolism, excreted by glomerular filtration
Prolonged half lives in neonates(3-5 hours in adults)
*Gentamicin* for burn patients
Function well in high pH
Only partial cross-resistance
##### Mechanism
- Bactericidal 
- Enter cell by Porins in *Gram -ve* bacteria.
- Gram +ve bacteria block all aminoglycosides but *streptomycin*
- Require O<sub>2</sub> for uptake which is why anaerobes are unaffected
- Irreversibly inhibit initiation complex by binding to 30S subunit
- Prevent polysome formation forming monosomes
- Results in misreading of codons or blockage of translocation entirely

##### Clinical Use
- Severe *Gram -ve rod* infections
	- UTI i.e. E.coli
	- Pneumonia
	- Neisseria meningitis
	- Peritonitis
	- Bacterial endocarditis
	- Sepsis
	- Streptomycin for TB
	- *Amikacin* for drug-resistant mycobacterium
- *Neomycin* given orally for bowel surgery
- Synergistic with Î²-lactam antibiotics([[Penicillins]], [[Cephalosporins]] etc.)
##### Adverse effects
- Nephrotoxicity(builds up in renal cortex)
- Neuromuscular blockade(reversible by calcium salts or *neostigmine*)
- Ototoxicity(builds up in endolymph/perilymph)
- Teratogenicity(Accumulates in fetal plasma and amniotic fluid)
##### Resistance
- Inactivation of drug by microbial enzymes(acetylation, phosphorylation, adenylation)
- Failure of drug to penetrate intracellularly
- Low affinity of drug for bacterial ribosome
