### Paramyxoviruses
#### Measles Virus(خسرہ)
SSRNA
-ve polarity
Helical symmetry
*Single serotype* so lifelong immunity
No treatment but Vitamin A supplementation can help

4 **C**'s of measles
**C**ough
**C**oryza
**C**onjunctivitis
"**C**"oplik spots
##### Replication
- Adsorption onto cell surface by *hemagglutinin*
- Penetration
- Uncoats and RNA polymerase transcribes -ve strand genome into mRNA
- Translation to proteins
- Assembly
- Matrix protein interaction with envelope and Release
##### Transmission
Present world-wide
- Spread by respiratory droplets
- Highly infectious during prodromal period
- **Transplacental**
###### Predisposing factors
- Malnourishment, especially in children
- Vitamin A deficiency
- Deficient Cell-mediated immunity(CMI)
- HIV
##### Pathogenesis and immunity
- Primary site of infection is the upper respiratory tract
- Spreads to blood and reticuloendothelial system
- Spreads to skin via blood
Bind to *CD-46* on macrophages, suppressing *IL-12* and *CMI*
Cytotoxic T cells attack infected endothelial cells visible as characteristic *rash* on skin
*Multi-nucleated giant cells* form due to fusion protein in spikes of virus
Weakened *CMI* allowing *M. Tuberculosis* can appear as an opportunistic infection
###### Immunity
Develops against *hemagglutinin*
Immunity from *CMI* rather than presence of IgG(only neutralizes)
Antibodies are transplacental
###### Prevention
- Live attenuated MMR vaccine
- 15m/o, booster at 4-6 y/o and at 10-12 y/o

##### Clinical features
- Incubation of 10-14 days
- Prodromal phase of fever, conjunctivitis, running nose(Coryza), coughing
- **Koplik's spots**(red lesion with central white spot on buccal mucosa)
- **Maculopapular rash** few days after appearance of Koplik's spots from face down to lower extremities(no sparing) goes *red*->*brown*
###### Complications
- Encephalitis with permanent sequelae(deafness, retardation)
- Primary pneumonia(Most common cause of death)
- Secondary bacterial pneumonia
- Otitis media
- Stillbirth in pregnant women
- Sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis



#### Mumps virus
Helical shape with SSRNA with -ve polarity
*Hemagglutinin* and *neuraminidase*
*Single serotype* so lifelong immunity
*S antigen* present
##### Replication
Same as measles
- Adsorption onto cell surface by *hemagglutinin*
- Penetration
- Uncoats and RNA polymerase transcribes -ve strand genome into mRNA
- Translation to proteins
- Assembly
- Matrix protein interaction with envelope and Release
##### Transmission
Present world-wide
- Spread by respiratory droplets
- Common subclinical infection in children
##### Pathogenesis and prevention
- Primary site of infection is Upper respiratory tract
- Spreads through blood
- May ascend from buccal mucosa up *Stensen's duct* 
- May spread via lymph
- Infects [[Salivary Glands|Parotid gland]] in particular
- Also spreads via blood to *testes*, ovaries, pancreas and rarely meninges
###### Prevention
- Live attenuated vaccine
- 15 m/o and booster at 4-6 y/o
- Ig do not assist with mitigation
##### Clinical features
- Incubation of 18-21 days
- Prodromal stage of fever, malaise, anorexia
- Tender swelling of salivary glands unilateral **OR** bilateral exacerbated by *citric juices*
- Spontaneously resolved in 1wk

###### Complications
- **Orchitis** in post-pubertal males causing infertility by *pressure necrosis*
- **Meningitis** self-limiting and benign, no sequelae
### Togavirus
#### Rubella virus
Icosahedral shape with SSRNA with +ve polarity
No viral RNA polymerase
*Hemagglutinin* present
*Single serotype* so lifelong immunity
##### Replication
- Adsorption onto cell surface by *hemagglutinin*
- Penetration
- Uncoating
- Translation of +ve strand RNA
Full process occurs in the cytoplasm
##### Transmission
Present world-wide
- Spread by respiratory droplets
- Highly infectious during prodromal period
- **Transplacental**
##### Pathogenesis and Prevention
- Primary site of infection is nasopharynx
- Spread to local lymph nodules and blood
- Ag-Ab mediated *Vasculitis* occurs resulting in a rash
###### Prevention
- Live attenuated MMR
- Immunity for 10 years
- Induces respiratory IgA as well
IG can be provided to known cases of rubella but may fail to prevent fetal infection

##### Clinical features
- Incubation of 14-21 days
- Mild shorter disease than measles
- Prodromal phase of fever and malaise
- **Maculopapular rash** lasting 3 days progressing from face downwards
- **Posterior auricular lymphadenopathy**
- **Polyarthritis** in women

###### Congenital Rubella Syndrome
- Infection in 1<sup>st</sup> trimester of pregnancy
- Teratogenic Viremia
- **Patent ductus arteriosus**
- **Cataract, Deafness**
- **Mental retardation**
- Asymptomatic but fecally contagious after birth



### Lab diagnosis
Generic and unnecessary IMO
#### Measles
- Clinical
- 4 fold increase in antibody titer
- Immunofluorescence
- PCR assay

#### Rubella
- Identified by interference with echovirus CPE in superimposed infection of echovirus
- Hemagglutination inhibition test
- ELISA
- 4 fold increase in antibody titer
- IgM indicate recent infection with IgG 1:8 titer indicates immunity
- PCR assay
- Amniocentesis of fetus

#### Mumps
- Clinical
- Hemagglutination inhibition test
- 4 fold increase in antibody titer
- V and S antigen detection
- PCR assay
- Mumps skin test
