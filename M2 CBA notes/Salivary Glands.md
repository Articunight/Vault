###### Major salivary glands
- Parotid gland
- Submandibular gland
- Sublingual gland
###### Minor salivary glands
- Labial
- Lingual
- Palatal
##### Parotid Gland
Largest gland
Mainly Serous acini
Long intercalated ducts, large striated ducts
Present below external auditory meatus behind ramus of mandible
Divided into superficial/deep by facial nerve
Opens behind third molar tooth

###### Nerve supply
- Glossopharyngeal CN9->Tympanic nerve->Otic Ganglion->Auriculotemporal nerve

##### Submandibular Gland
90% Serous + Mucous acini
Serous Demilunes present
Long Striated ducts
Present below lower border of body of mandible
Divided into superficial/deep by mylohyoid muscle
Opens lateral to frenulum of [[Tongue]]

###### Nerve supply
- Facial Nerve CN7->Chorda Tympani->Submandibular Ganglion

##### Sublingual Gland
Primarily Mucous acini
Short intralobular ducts(intercalated + striated)
Present in floor of mouth near frenulum
Opens into sublingual fold

###### Nerve supply
- Facial Nerve CN7->Chorda Tympani->Submandibular Ganglion

##### CLINICALS(4)

###### Frey's Syndrome
- Sweating upon salivary stimulus
- Injury to auriculotemporal/great auricular nerve
- Improper regeneration causes fusion of fibers of the two
- Stimulus for saliva ends up triggering sweating

###### Parotid Duct injury
- Parotid is relatively superficial
- Easily injured from physical trauma

###### Parotid neoplasm
- Close relation to facial nerve
- Mass effect can cause facial palsy if benign
- Unilateral facial paralysis if malignant

###### Sialolithiasis
- Formation of a calculus(stone)
- Blocks the duct resulting in swelling and pain with salivary stimulus
###### Sialadenitis
Infection of the salivary glands
Caused by(3):
	-Retrograde infection via duct
	- Mumps
	- Sialolithiasis

#### General Histology
Compound tubulo-acinar glands
- Alveoli contain
	- Epithelial cells
	- Basket cells
	- Myoepithelial cells
	- Basement membrane
- 3 types
	- Serous
	- Mucous
	- Seromucous

##### Parenchyma
Glandular epithelium, secretory acini, branching duct system
Epithelium can be serous, mucous or both
###### Serous Cells
Pyramidal cells with spherical nuclei
Broad Basophilic base(filled with mitochondria and RER)
Narrow Acidophilic apex(filled with zymogen granules)
Serous(watery) secretion
More amylase activity
###### Mucous Cells
Pyramidal cells with flattened basal nuclei
Apical region has mucinogen granules which stain poorly
Mucous(thick/Mucin/GP rich) secretion
Large alveoli with wide lumen generally
###### Serous demilunes
Half-moon shaped serous cells
Secrete lysozyme and have antimicrobial action
##### Stroma
Supporting C.T. framework
Separates into lobes and lobules
Rich in lymphocytes and plasma cells

##### Ducts
Intercalated and striated ducts are part of intralobular ducts
###### Intercalated ducts
Simple cuboidal epithelium
Bicarbonate secretion
Chloride absorption
###### Striated Duct
Simple low columnar epithelium
Intensely eosinophilic with basal striations
Bicarb and Potassium secretion
Sodium reabsorption

Interlobular, interlobar, main salivary duct are all excretory ducts
simple cuboidal, pseudostratified columnar, stratified columnar epithelium respectively
