###### Antibiotics
Antibiotics refers to the substances which are produced by organisms which are known to selectively retard growth or kill other microorganisms
###### Antimicrobial agents
Broad term including all synthetic/semisynthetic agents
##### Classification
- MOA
- Target organism
##### Selection
- ###### Identification
	- Gram stain
	- Culture
	- PCR(especially for viral proteins)
	- MALDI-TOF(Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight)
	- Beta-lactamase assay of flight
- ###### Susceptibility
	- Bacteriostatic drugs(arrest growth)
	- Bactericidal(kill cells)
	- Minimum Inhibitory concentration
		- Lowest antimicrobial concentration preventing visible growth of organism in plasma
	- Minimum bactericidal concentration
		- Lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that results in a 99.9% decline in colony 
- ###### Site of infection
	- Lipid solubility
	- Molecular weight
	- Protein binding
	- Susceptibility to transporters or efflux pumps
- ###### Patient factors
	- Immune system
	- Renal dysfunction(Age-relevant)
	- Hepatic dysfunction(Age relevant)
	- Poor perfusion
	- Age
- ###### Safety of the agent
- ###### Cost of therapy
##### Rational dosing
Deciding what dosing regimen to give to a patient on the basis of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
- ###### Concentration-dependent killing
	- Rate increases as concentration of antibiotic increases *greatly above* MIC
	- High bolus preferred
	- Aminoglycosides and daptomycin
- ###### Time-dependent killing
	- Clinical efficacy is best predicted by % of time drug concentration remains *above* MIC
	- Penicillin and cephalosporins
- ###### Post-antibiotic effect
	- Persistent suppression of microbial growth despite drug concentration *below* MIC
	- One dose per day especially for gram -
	- Aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones
##### Resistance
- Reduced entry of drug into pathogen
- Resistance due to drug efflux
- Resistance due to destruction of antibiotic
- Resistance due to altered target structure
##### Mutations
- spontaneous, random, stable and heritable genetic change in microorganisms
- These cells may have a few mutant cells which require a higher concentration of antimicrobial agent
- Selectively preserved, Darwinism occurs and the resistant cell type proliferates

##### Types and goals
- ###### Prophylactic
	- Targeted therapy
	- Pre-infection
- ###### Pre-emptive therapy
	- early wide-spectrum targeted therapy in high-risk patients
	- Post-infection, pre-symptomatic
- ###### Empirical therapy
	- Post-symptomatic
	- Late wide-spectrum on the basis of experience
- ###### Definitive therapy
	- Targeted monotherapy. Rarely combination therapy
	- After Pathogen identification
- ###### Post-treatment suppressive therapy
	- Prevent reappearance of symptoms
	- Low-dose
	- Post-resolution
