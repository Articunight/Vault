____
###### Benign
Benign neoplasms generally have well-differentiated cells that closely resemble normal counterparts
well differentiated benign tumors have rare mitoses and have normal configuration
###### Malignant
Malignant neoplasms have a wide range of parenchymal cell diff
Abnormal mitoses are common(multipolar spindles)
Pleomorphism(Changes in shape/size)
###### Exceptions
Adenocarcinoma of thyroid gland may contain normal-appearing follicles
identification is done on the basis of site of invasion(Lymph/vessel/nerve)
#### Benign/Malignant
- Differentiation and anaplasia
- [[Metastasis and local invasion|Metastasis]]
- [[Metastasis and local invasion|Local Invasion]]
##### Differentiation and Anaplasia

###### Benign
- Well differentiated
- Resemble physiological state
- Rare mitoses, normal configuration
- Maintain physiological functions
###### Malignant
- Wide range of differentiation
- Dysplasia(Pleomorphism, atypical mitoses, loss of polarity)
- Hyperchromatism
- Anaplastic giant cells
- May exaggerate physiological functions and increase functions
- Desmoplasia


###### Dysplasia
Pre-Cancerous lesion of epithelium
Loss in uniformity of individual cells 
Atypical architectural growth pattern
Has many features of malignancy, but is generally reversible except for "Carcinoma in situ"
divided by level of epithelial involvement
- Mild 1/3
- Moderate 2/3
- Severe(Carcinoma in situ) 3/3
Carcinoma in situ is considered a pre-invasive stage
If dysplastic tissue reaches the basement membrane it is invasive

Lifestyle changes
- Eat
- sleep
- exercise
- social connections
- stress
- Drugs/medication
