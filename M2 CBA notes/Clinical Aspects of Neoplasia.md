### Effects of tumor on host
Depends largely on location irrespective of malignancy
i.e.
Pituitary adenoma can cause hypopituitarism
Leiomyoma can cause renal ischemia and hypertension
Tumor in the head of the pancreas can obstruct the common bile duct
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma can present with hyperinsulinism
so we have a bunch of syndromes

#### Cancer Cachexia
Progressive loss of body fat 
followed by fatigue, anorexia, anemia
Caused by cytokine release from tumor and host
High caloric expenditure and BMR
Suspected that TNF suppresses appetite and inhibits FA metabolism

#### Paraneoplastic syndromes
Symptom complexes from cancer are often inexplicable
Important for palliative care/diagnostic
##### Examples
- ###### Hypercalcemia
	- PTHrP(Para-thyroid releasing protein) synthesis by tumor cells.
	- TGF-Î± and calcitriol synthesis
- ###### Cushing syndrome
	- Ectopic production of ACTH/similar products, Common in lung cancer
- ###### Thrombotic endocarditis(non-bacterial)
	- Hypercalcemia + Clotting factor synthesis results in hypercoagulability
	- Leads to venous thrombosis and thrombotic endocarditis
- ###### Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy
	- Common in lung adenocarcinoma
