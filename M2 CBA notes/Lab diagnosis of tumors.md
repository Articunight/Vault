Several subcategories
Radiological is the most primary but not in the scope of a pathologist

#### Morphological methods(3)
##### Histology(7)
- ###### Tissue excision
	- Most detail
	- Patient suffers more? idfk
- ###### Biopsy
	- An incisional biopsy takes a portion of physiological and pathological tissue
	- An excisional biopsy takes a portion of pathological tissue
	- Punch biopsy
	- Needle/core biopsy
	- Center may be largely necrotic
	- Margins may not be representative(helps figure out if resection was complete or incomplete)
- ###### Frozen Section
	- Sample is quick-frozen, sectioned
	- Allows formation of permanent sections(last for a HUGE amount of time)
	- Less detailed than biopsies or tissue excision
- ###### Fine-needle aspiration cytology(FNAC)
	- Aspiration of cells from mass
	- Cytological examination
	- Used for readily palpable lesions
	- Helps prevent surgical diagnostic risks
- ###### Cytological smear
	- Papanicolaou smears
	- Fluid cytology(secretions), exfoliative cytology(scrape off) or FNAC
	- Commonly used to identify carcinoma in situ for cervical cancer
	- Also usable for endometrial, bronchogenic, bladder, prostate
	- Works on the basis of neoplastic cells being less cohesive and easily shed into fluids and secretions
	- These cells can be examined for hallmarks of cancer(pleomorphism, anaplasia etc.)
- ###### Immunohistochemistry
	- Detects certain proteins with specific tagged monoclonal antibodies
	- Especially important for undifferentiated cell
		- Cytokeratin to give differential against large cell lymphoma
		- Detection of PSA in metastatic deposits to detect primary tumor
		- Detection of estrogen receptors to detect breast cancer
- ###### Flow cytometry
	- Specific monoclonal tagged antibodies
	- Helps obtain phenotype/number of malignant cells in a sample
##### Tumor markers
Biochemical assays of serum, CSF, urine etc. can be checked for tumor-associated products(enzymes, hormones, etc.)
###### Uses
- help detect
- type of cancer
- Show treatment response
- Detect recurrence of cancer
###### Limitations
- Low sensitivity and specificity
###### Examples from slides(5)
- HCG->Trophoblastic tumors
- Î±-Fetoprotein-> Liver cancer
- CEA(carcinoembryonic antigen)-> Colon cancer, pancreas, stomach, lung
- PAP(prostatic acid phosphatase)-> Prostate adenocarcinoma
- PSA/Free PSA-> Differentiate between BPH and Prostate cancer



##### Molecular diagnosis
- ###### Diagnosis of malignancy(3)
	- PCR
		- Identifies specific T-cells or Ig genes or *JAK 2* mutations that may be neoplastic. BCR-ABL.
	- FISH(Fluorescent in situ hybridization)
		- Such as Ewing sarcoma, leukemias, lymphomas, BCR-ABL gene detection(chronic myeloid leukemia), *polycythemia vera*
	- Microarrays
- ###### Prognosis and behavior
	- Identifies oncogenic amplification of *HER2* and *NMYC*
	- Provides therapeutic and prognostic info for breast cancer and  neuroblastomas respectively
	- Detection of *TP53* mutation which gives a poor prognosis.
- ###### Detection of minimal residual disease
	- 
- ###### Predisposition to cancer 
- ###### Therapeutic decision-making
