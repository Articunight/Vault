Lab diagnosis 2

50 mg of culture medium powder
1L of water
Enter into Autoclave(110lb pressure)
Dissolves the media
Pour 20ml from flask into petri dish
Wait 0.5-1 Hour
Becomes a gel-like consistency

McConkey is pink
- Selective media for lactose fermenting and non-lactose fermenting
CLED is green-blue
- Used specially for urine
Blood Agar requires you to place 10 ml of blood in petri dish when gel has temperature of 37 C(Red color)

Mark the petri dish areas and divide
Dip wire loop into sample
Touch wire loop gently on gel surface

For antibiotic sensitivity rub wire loop with sample on entirety of dish

Add microdiscs of antibiotic with forceps
Place in marked quadrants on agar plate
incubate at 37 C

Size of circle around microdisc shows sensitivity/resistance
greater than 17 mm shows bacterial sensitivity to antibiotic(bacteria can't even get near the antibiotic)
Less than 17 mm shows bacterial resistance to antibiotic(bacteria easily ignores antibiotic)
