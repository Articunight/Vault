___
==106-112==
Gram +ve cocci
Appear in grape-like clusters
Part of human flora.
#### Transmission
Transmitting primarily by hand contact, contaminated environments and fomites. Foreign bodies(sutures, catheters, prosthetics are predisposing factors)
*S. Aureus* present on the skin of 30% of people
*S. Aureus* present in the vagina of 5% of women(High predisposition for Toxic Shock) 
*S. Epidermidis* present on skin
*S. Saprophyticus* present on genital mucosa

#### Virulence factors(6)
##### Catalase
- Neutralizes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from neutrophils
##### Coagulase
- Specific to *S. Aureus*
- Allows fibrin to clot resulting in abscess formation
##### Staphyloxanthin
- Specific to *S. Aureus*
- Carotenoid pigment giving golden color
- Inactivates *ROS* like superoxide
##### Hemolysins
- Specific to *S. Aureus*
- Allows iron utilization from lysing RBCs
- Marks it as β-hemolytic 
##### Antibiotic resistance
- β-lactamase degrades most [[Penicillins]]
- Altered *PBP* provide methicillin resistance
- Substitution of *D-Lactate* for *D-Alanine* provide vancomycin resistance
##### Antigens
###### Protein A
- Major protein of cell wall in *S. Aureus*
- Binds to Fc-IgG inhibiting complement activation
- Reduced opsonization and phagocytosis as a result
###### Teichoic acids
- Ribitol Phosphate polymers
- Help adhere to mucosal cells
- Cause septic shock by inducing *IL-1* and *TNF*

#### Pathogenesis
Typical lesion is *abscess*, centrally necrotic draining to the outside
May disseminate and form *metastatic abscess*
Produce 5 main toxins
##### Enterotoxin
- Causes food poisoning
- Heat-resistant
- Prominent vomiting with non-bloody diarrhea
- Acts as a *Superantigen* in GIT which stimulates *IL-1* *IL-2* and helper T cells
- Cytokine release stimulates vomiting center
##### TSST-1
- Present in 5-25% of *S. Aureus*
- Causes toxic shock
- Common with women using tampons, wound infections and due to nasal packing in nosebleeds
- Acts as a *Superantigen* releasing *IL-1* *IL-2* and *TNF*
##### Exfoliatin
- Causes *scalded skin syndrome*
- Epidermolytic, acts as a protease
- Cleaves *desmoglein* in desmosomes
##### Alpha toxin and P-V leukocidin
- Alpha toxin causes skin necrosis and hemolysis
- P-V leukocidin is a *pore-forming* toxin causing severe skin and soft tissue infection. Kills leukocytes.
- S. aureus causes severe necrotizing pneumonia when equipped with this toxin
##### Enzymes
- Coagulase
- Staphylokinase(fibrinolysin) 
- Hyaluronidase
#### Staphylococcus Aureus
Catalase +ve
Coagulase +ve
Golden-yellow colony
Turns Mannitol-salt agar yellow(ferments Mannitol)
β-Hemolytic
Treated by
- β-lactamase resistant [[Penicillins]](Nafcillin or cloxacillin)
- Certain [[Cephalosporins]]
- Vancomycin(for MRSA or NRSA)
- Daptomycin(for VRSA strain)
##### Diseases
- ###### Pyogenic infections
	- Skin, soft tissue infections
		- Treated by *Mupirocin* applied *topically* 
	- Abscesses
		- S. Aureus makes coagulase and toxins. Forms a fibrin clot around itself
		- Called metastatic abscesses due to always being distant
		- Treated by *Incision and drainage*(I&D)
	- Impetigo, furuncles, carbuncles, cellulitis, lymphangitis
	- Conjunctivitis
- ###### Septic arthritis/Osteomyelitis
	- Hematogenous spread from distant infected site
- ###### Gastroenteritis(Toxin-mediated)
	- Food poisoning caused by *enterotoxins* (heat stable)
	- Incubation of 2-6 hours
	- Emesis more prominent than diarrhea (non-bloody)
- ###### Scalded skin syndrome(Toxin-mediated)
	- Caused by *Exfoliatin* toxin
	- Skin starts sloughing off and exudes serous fluid
	- Fever
	- Large bullae
	- Erythematous macular rash
- ###### Endocarditis
	- Occurs on prosthetic heart valves
	- Common in IV drug users
- ###### Toxic shock syndrome(Toxin-mediated)
	- TSST-1 is a superantigen binding to *MHC-II* and *T-cell* receptor
	- Polyclonal T-cell activation and Cytokine release
	- Fever
	- Emesis
	- Diffuse macular rash that desquamates
	- Involves 3 or more systems(liver, kidney, GIT, CNS, muscle, blood)
	- Associated with prolonged use of vaginal tampons or nasal packing
- ###### Post-Op infections
- ###### Severe necrotizing Pneumonia(PVL)
	- Common in CA-MRSA
#### Other staphylococci
Catalase +ve
Coagulase -ve
Urease -ve
White colonies
*S. epidermidis* is *Novobiocin* sensitive while *S. saprophyticus* is resistant
γ-Hemolytic(non-hemolytic)
##### S. Epidermidis
Hospital-acquired
Has a glycocalyx coat that especially adheres to implants
Treated by *nafcillin* or *vancomycin +Rifampicin* depending on methicillin resistance
- Targets IV catheters and prosthetics
- Endocarditis
- Arthritis
- Osteomyelitis
- Sepsis(especially in neonates)
- Peritonitis
##### S. Saprophyticus
Community-acquired
Most common cause of UTIs after E. coli
Treated with [[Cotrimoxazole|TMP-SMX]]
##### S. Lugdunensis
Uncommon coagulase-negative bacteria. Causes prosthetic valve endocarditis and skin infections
