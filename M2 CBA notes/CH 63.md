###### Basic functions
- Movement
- Secretion
- Absorption
- Blood circulation
- Local neuronal and humoral control

##### Physiological anatomy
- Serosa(intraperitoneal)
- Longitudinal smooth muscle
- *Myenteric plexus*
- Circular smooth muscle
- *Submucosal plexus*
- Submucosa
- Mucosa
	- Muscularis mucosa
	- Lamina propria
	- Epithelium

##### Smooth muscle
200-500 micrometer in length
2-10 micrometer in diameter
Connected via *gap junctions*
Function as a *Syncytium*
###### Electrical activity
RMP avg is -56mV
- Slow waves
	- Rhythmic electrical impulses made by *interstitial cells of Cajal*
	- Cause spikes
	- 5-15 mV
	- 3/min in stomach
	- 12/min in duodenum
	- 9/min in ileum
	- Caused by sodium intake
- Spikes
	- True action potentials
	- Actively cause contractions
	- -40 mV threshold potential
	- 1-10 spikes per second
	- Last 10-20 mS due to slow opening and closing of channels
	- Rely on *Ca<sup>2+</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>channels*
	- Affected by Distention, Ach/NOREPI/EPI, GIT hormones
	- Caused by calcium intake
Some degree of tonic contraction also occurs due to repeated spike potentials, GIT hormones or by an alternative method of calcium ion inflow

##### Neural control of GIT
Enteric nervous system
Sympathetic and parasympathetic routes both connect to enteric nervous system but aren't necessary for function
Also has connections with epithelium of gut wall for local reflexes and to the brain stem

###### Myenteric
- Increases tonic contraction
- Increases intensity of rhythmic contractions
- Increases rate of rhythmic contractions
- Increases velocity of conduction of excitatory waves
inhibitory functions via VIP(vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) to inhibit contraction of pyloric/ileocecal sphincters
###### Submucosal
- Local secretion
- Absorption
- Submucosal muscle contraction

##### Autonomic control
