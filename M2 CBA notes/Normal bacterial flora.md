[[incomplete]]
Parasitism
Neutralism
Synergism
Commensalism: Organism derives benefit from host but do not damage it 
Generally gut flora within the human microbiome involves commensals
##### Resident flora
Fixed organisms that re-establish if disturbed
- Skin(groin, armpit, between toes)
- Respiratory tract(nose oropharynx)
- Colon
- Vagina
##### Transient flora
Temporarily inhabit skin and mucus membranes for hours/days
May not multiply and normally die
Derived from environment
Either get washed away, or fail to compete with resident flora, or conditions are inadequate(too alkaline, too acidic)
##### Sterile sites
Blood, CSF, Synovial, pleural, pericardial fluid etc.
Deep tissues like muscles lower respiratory tract, organs(liver, spleen, kidney, bladder)
##### Germ-free animals
Lab-derived, no bacterial flora compared to conventional animals

___
### Levinson
#### Human microbiome
Microbial populations routine found on and in the body
Take a few years after birth to be established after which they're considered *Resident flora*
Commonly called *Commensals*(Take benefit from and do not disadvantage the host)
This is different from a *carrier state* which requires the individual to be colonized
Internal organs generally considered sterile sites

##### Advantages
- ###### Helps development of immune response
	- Important for *GALT* development
	- With a poor microbiome size of *Peyer's patches* decreases
	- Proportion of T cells(Th1, Th2, and Th17)
- ###### Susceptibility or resistance to pathogen colonization
	-
