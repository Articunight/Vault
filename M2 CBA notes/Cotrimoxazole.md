___
### Cotrimoxazole
Combination drug consisting of Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(TMP-SMX)
Ratio 1:5
Congener of sulfisoxazole
Pyrimidine inhibitor of DHFR
Bactericidal
Inhibits 2 steps in synthesis of Tetrahydrofolic acid

#### Sulfonamides
##### Mechanism
Inhibit *dihydropteroate synthase*, thus inhibiting folate synthesis.
Prevent **PABA->Dihydropteroic Acid**
Bacteriostatic (bactericidal when combined with TMP).
Binds to albumin in blood
##### Clinical Use
- Gram +ve 
- Gram -ve
- Nocardia
- UTI(TMP-SMX used)
##### Adverse effects
- Hypersensitivity reactions
- Hemolysis in G6PD deficiency
- Nephrotoxicity
- Photosensitivity
- Stevens-johnson syndrome
- Kernicterus in infants
- Toxicity with Albumin-bound drugs
##### Resistance
- Resistance develops easily when TMX or SMX are used on their own
- *Bacterial dihydropteroate synthase* enzyme alteration
- Decreased Sulfonamide uptake
- Increased *PABA* synthesis
#### Trimethoprim
##### Mechanism
Inhibit *dihydrofolate reductase*, thus inhibiting folate synthesis.
Prevent **Dihydrofolic acid->Tetrahydrofolic acid**
Bacteriostatic (bactericidal when combined with TMP).
##### Clinical Use
Used with sulfonamides
TMP-SMX combination
- UTI
- Shigella
- Salmonella
- Pneumocystis jirovecii(pneumocystis pneumonia)
- Pneumonia
- Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis
##### Adverse effects
- Hyperkalemia(high doses similar mechanism to potassium-sparing diuretics)
- Megaloblastic anemia
- Leukopenia
- Granulocytopenia
- TERATOGENIC
