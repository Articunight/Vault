###### General approach
1. Obtain specimen
2. Stain using apt procedure and microscopically examine(not conclusive, but helps with empirical therapy)
	- Size
	- Arrangement
	- Color
3. Culture specimen on apt media
4. Identify using apt test
	Note features such as hemolysis and pigment formation
5. Perform antibiotic susceptibility test

###### Quality assurance
1. Lab requisition form
	- No. of sample
	- Name, age, sex, time of collection
	- Type of specimen
2. Perform test on written signed

###### Precautions
1. Requisition form should be completed
2. Collect sample before administration of antimicrobials, or 1-3 days after cessation on antimicrobials
3. Collect at acute phase of disease
4. Obtain sample relevant to disease(sputum not saliva for RTI)
5. Apply aseptic techniques to avoid contamination with env. or body flora
	- Wash hands
	- Sterile container
	- Seal and clean external part of container
6. Quantity needs to be apt
7. Transport immediately

###### Rejection criteria
- Missing or inadequate id
- Insufficient quantity
- Specimen collected in inapt container
- Suspected contamination
- Unknown time delay
- Hemolyzed blood sample
###### Procedure(blood)
1. Wash hands and wear sterile gloves
2. Palpate vein before applying disinfectant
3. Swab concentrically(start centrally, move spirally outwards) with 2% tincture iodine
4. Clean skin with isopropyl alcohol scrubbing and on rubber stopper of blood culture bottle
5. Allow disinfectant to dry
6. Draw apt amount of blood from new syringe
7. Inject sample into collection bottle by piercing rubber cap with syringe needle
8. Label
9. Write relevant clinical notes
10. Deliver as soon as possible, keep at room temp

###### Procedure(CSF)(incomplete)
1. Wash site with 2% iodine
2. Cleanse iodine with 70% alcohol
3. A sterile wide bore needle is inserted b/w L4-L5 and CSF is allowed to drip into dry sterile container
4. Always collect 2 specimens 1-2ml each
5. Sample must reach lab within 10 minutes

Focus on blood, high vaginal swab, urine culture, CSF
