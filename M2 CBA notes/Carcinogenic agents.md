#### Oncogenic RNA viruses
##### HTLV-1(Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1)
Only retrovirus capable of causing cancer
endemic to Japan, Caribbean basin, south America, Africa
Tropism for *CD4+ T cells*
Spread by intercourse, blood products, breastfeeding
leukemia in 3-5% of individuals with latent period of 40-60 years


Does not possess an oncogene
but leukemic cells show a clonal pattern
Although integration into host chromosomes is random
All cancerous cells show the same integration site for viral RNA(i.e. it can infect site 1, 2, 3 or 4 but if it infects site 4 and it becomes cancerous, ALL cancerous cells will have an infected site 4)
this implies that HTLV-1 is the causative agent, rather than a passenger that infects post-cancer

###### Process
Utilizes *tax* gene/protein for viral replication
which also alters transcription of host cell genes
and interacts with signaling proteins.
This contributes to the following cancer hallmarks:
- Increased survival and growth
	- Interacts with PI3 kinase stimming signal cascade
	- Upregulates cell cycle via cyclin D and CDK inhibitors
	- Upregulates NF-KB transcription
- Increased genomic instability
	- interferes with DNA-repair by inhibiting cell cycle checkpoints
This also increases the likelihood of accumulating further oncogenic mutations

#### Oncogenic DNA viruses
##### HPV
Human papillomavirus
*HPV-6* and *HPV-11* only cause benign genital warts and are LOW-RISK
*HPV-16* and *HPV-18* can cause SCC of cervix and are HIGH-RISK 
High risk variants produce oncogenic viral DNA that have high affinity
Generally immune abnormalities(HIV) help in the progression of HPV to a cancerous state
###### Process
- E6 viral gene acts to degrade Tumor suppressor p53
	- Increases TERT expression(subunit of telomerase)
- E7 viral gene acts to degrade Retinoblastoma(RB) protein
	- Promotes progression through cell cycle
	- inactivates CDK inhibitor complexes *p21*, *p27* and activates *cyclin E* and *cyclin A*
- In general contribute to genomic instability
##### EBV
Epstein-Barr virus
Herpesvirus that causes *Burkitt lymphoma* but can be found in many other tumors
Targets B-cells
Also associated with *Nasopharyngeal carcinoma*
Endemic to Africa
Latent membrane protein 1(*LMP1*) acts as oncogene by mimicking effect of *CD40* receptor increasing proliferation.
This is antigenic and can be detected by the immune system normally

###### Process
- Uses *CD21* to attach to B cells
- Polyclonal B cell proliferation by *CD40*-like action(LMP1)
- Immortal B lymphoblastoid production and subsequent elimination by immune response
- Production of lymphoma with *MYC* oncogene mutations t(8;14)
- Immune evasion hallmark added
In immunosuppressed patients higher likelihood of multi-site EBV-positive B-cell tumors
MYC mutation unnecessary, infected cells directly express LMP-1 and EBNA
##### HBV/HCV
Main cause of hepatocellular carcinomas
Multifactorial oncogenic effects
Suspected cause: *maladaptive immune response* after chronic inflammation
*HBx* genome from HBV activates signal transduction pathways and production of transcription factors
*HCx* involved directly in tumorigenesis by activating signal transduction
###### Process
- Chronic viral infection
- Compensatory hepatocyte proliferation
- Inflammatory response
- ROS generation, growth factor secretion, cytokine release
- *NF-KB pathway* activation due to immune mediators blocks apoptosis
- This allows accumulation of mutations
##### H. pylori
Causes gastric adenocarcinomas and gastric lymphomas
Only known carcinogenic bacterium
Similar process to HBV/HCV

*Gastric adenocarcinoma*
Cytotoxin-associated A gene(*CagA*) gene injected into gastric epithelial cells
Induces a cascade similar to growth factor stimulation leading to proliferation and eventual mutation

*Gastric lymphomas*
B-cell origin, Tumor forms from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue(MALT)
Involves polymorphism in inflammatory cytokine promoters(such as *IL-1Î²* or *TNF*)
This activates H. pylori-reactive T-cells which cause B-cell proliferation until mutations occur forming a MALT lymphoma
