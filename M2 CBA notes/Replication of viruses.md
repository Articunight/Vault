___
#### Attachment
- Interaction through weak non-covalent bonding on specific sites
	- Can be via *glycoprotein spikes* or *surface receptor proteins*(CD4+, Ach, Complement proteins, EGF)
- This specificity shows
	- Host range of virus
	- Tissue/organ specificity
	- Susceptibility or resistance of species to virus
#### Penetration
- ##### Receptor-mediated endocytosis
	- Enveloped viruses fuse with membrane of endosome
	- Releasing nucleocapsid into cytoplasm
	- Risk of degradation of virion by lysozymes
- ##### Direct membrane fusion
	- Enveloped viruses may fuse envelope with plasma membrane of cell
	- Bypass lysozyme action
#### Uncoating
- Disassembly of virion
- Uncoating occurs intracellularly
- Begins viral gene expression and loses specificity

#### Gene expression
- ##### DNA viruses
	- DNA viruses generally replicate in nucleus(Except *Pox virus*)
	- All use Host-cell RNA polymerase(Except *Pox virus*)
	- All are double stranded(Except *Parvo virus* which relies on host DNA polymerase)
- ##### RNA viruses
	- All single stranded(Except *Reovirus*)
	- Most replicate in cytoplasm(Except *Influenza virus* and *Retroviruses* which replicate in nucleus)
	- Split into 4 groups
		- ###### Group I
			- SSRNA of positive polarity
			- Genome acts as mRNA
			- *Poliovirus*
		- ###### Group II
			- SSRNA of negative polarity
			- Replicate via mRNA of genome
			- Virus uses its own RNA polymerase
			- *Paramyxovirus* *Rabies virus*
		- ###### Group III
			- DSDNA
			- Viral RNA polymerase
			- *Rotavirus*
		- ###### Group IV
			- SSRNA of positive polarity
			- Replicated via reverse transcriptase
			- *Retroviruses*

#### Assembly and Release
##### Assembly
- Occurs in compartments specific to virus(nucleus, cytoplasm etc.)
- Nucleic acid is packaged in capsid producing a *Naked Virus*
- Envelope acquired by budding from host cell membrane(*Herpesvirus* acquires it from nuclear membrane)
##### Release
- Lytic phase
- Budding of CSM
- **Burst time**: Time from phage attachment to release of new virion.
- **Burst size**: Number of particles emerging from cell
#### Lysogeny
- Long term persistent infection: Integration of viral DNA into host cell chromosome. No progeny virions produced at the time. Occurs in Bacteria
##### Lysogenic cycle
- Integration forms a *Prophage*
- All daughter cells inherit the viral DNA
##### Lysogenic conversion
- Host bacteria cell acquires new properties
- Capability to synthesize exotoxins(Diphtheria, botulinum, cholera)
##### Lysogeny and viral latency
- Latency associated transcript: non-coding regulatory RNA that suppresses replication
- Environmental conditions can induce virus to resume lytic phase

**Cytopathic effects**: Microscopic or macroscopic morphologic changes and derangement of function in infected cell. Occurs primarily in *Lytic phase*
- Increase in cell size
- Dark colored granules(*Inclusion bodies*)
- Cell lysis
- Conversion into tumor cell
