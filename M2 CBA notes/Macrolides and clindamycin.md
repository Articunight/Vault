___

##### Macrolides
Azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin

###### Mechanism
Inhibits protein synthesis by blocking translocation
Binds to 50S subunit
Resistance develops by methylation of 23S rRNA-binding site which prevents binding
Clarithromycin and erythromycin specifically inhibit CP450
Bacteriostatic
###### Clinical use
- Atypical pneumonias(Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, legionella)
- STI(Chlamydia, N. gonorrhoeae)
- Gram +ve cocci(strep infections when penicillin isn't viable)
- B. Pertussis(whooping cough)
- N. gonorrhoeae
###### Adverse effects
*MACRO* 
- Gastrointestinal *M*otility
- *A*rrhythmia by prolonged QT
- *C*holestatic hepatitis
- *R*ash
- e*O*sinophilia
Clarithromycin and erythromycin specifically inhibit CP450, making P450 metabolized drugs more likely to cause toxicity.
Ototoxicty is possible from *Erythromycin* and *Azithromycin*
##### Clindamycin
###### Mechanism
Blocks translocation at 50S ribosomal subunit
Bacteriostatic
###### Clinical Use
Anaerobic infections(clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides spp.)
Lung abscess
oral infection
Effective against group A strep infection
###### Adverse effects
Pseudomembranous colitis
