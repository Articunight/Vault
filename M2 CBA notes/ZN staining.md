Ziel-Neelsen stain

Mycobacteria are difficult to stain via gram staining
Thick cell wall with long-chain FA(mycolic acid) which means gram staining isn't possible
Primary stain is *Carbol Fuchsin*
Due to being lipid soluble

Enhanced by steam heating to melt the lipids allowing stain to move into cell
Acid used to decolorize *nonacid-fast cells* 
*Acid-fast cells* can resist this decolorization and appear under microscope
Counterstaining by *Malachite green* or *methylene blue*

Cells that retain the primary stain are known as Acid-fast cells

- #### Procedure
	1. Make smear of sample
	2. Pour Carbol fuchsin
	3. Steam heat until fumes appear(don't boil) for 5 mins
	4. Pour decolorizer(Acid alcohol) and wait for 30 secs
	5. Wash with clean water
	6. Cover smear with malachite green or methylene blue for 1-2 mins
	7. Wash with clean water
	8. Add 1-2 drops of cedar wood oil

Acid fast bacilli will appear pinkish-red
Background/stroma will be green or blue depending on counterstain
