[[Neoplasia]]


==pg 194==
___
###### breast cancer
Bone and Brain cancer likely secondary cancer
###### colon cancer
For all GIT cancers liver is the most common site
since its an adenocarcinoma lymphatics are preferred
Peritoneum is involved and a site for metastasis
Lungs and Brain also possible
###### lung cancer
spreads to bronchi and lymphatics, Thoracic cavity
Bone and Brain possible for distant metastasis

Iatrogenic is also possible during surgery

#### Metastasis
Spread of tumor to sites physically discontinuous with primary tumor
Marks tumor as malignant
Invasiveness allows penetration into vessels and cavities
Generally depends on level of anaplasia and size of tumor
Exceptions exist: Basal cell carcinomas rarely metastasize, CNS tumors rarely metastasize
##### Pathways
- ###### Seeding within body cavities
	- Invasion of abdominal/thoracic cavity etc.
	- May cover entirety of peritoneum but won't invade underlying tissues
- Lymphatic spread
	- More typical of carcinomas
	- Sentinel lymph nodes are first regional lymph nodes that receive flow from a primary tumor
- Hematogenous spread
	- More typical of sarcomas
	- Allows easy spread to Bone, Brain, Liver, Lungs

Lecture stuff here
2 things depend on metastasis site
Anatomy location, vascular drainage, tropism of tumors for specific tissues
Factors inc cell motility
decreased adherence of tumor cells 
inc growth factor secretion
inc secretion of motility factor
fail
Antibiotic therapy used for mild dysplasia(1/3)

#### Local Invasion
Cancerous growth is accompanied by progressive infiltration, invasion, destruction of surrounding tissues.
Benign tumors grow as cohesive expansile masses surrounded by desmoplasia due to hypoxic damage to surrounding cells. 
Exceptions exist i.e. leiomyoma of uterus
Apart from metastases, local invasion is the most significant feature distinguishing malignancy from benign tumors
###### ECM
Constitutes basement membrane and interstitial matrix
acts as a barrier against dysplastic epithelial cells 
Involves fibers, proteoglycans
(Integrins anchor cell to ECM and relay signals from ECM to cell)

### Invasion and metastasis
Major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality
Interactions between ECM, stromal cells and cancer cells
 - #### Invasion of ECM
		Carcinoma breaches basement membrane
		goes through interstitial connective tissue
		reaches vascular area
		embolizes
		Process reverses at a metastatic site
	- ##### Process
		- Loosening of intracellular connections(E-cadherin expression reduced)
		- Local degradation of B.M. or C.T.(Tumor proteolytic enzymes)
		- Changes in attachment of tumor cells(Creates novel sites that bind to tumor cell receptors)
		- Locomotion(signaling proteins help in moving throw the degraded basement membrane)
- #### Vascular dissemination + Tropism
	Millions of tumor cells are shed into circulation daily.
	Process is inefficient, tumor cells vulnerable to immune action, adhesion to vascular bed etc.
	Growth at meta site difficult due to lack of stromal support, suppression of tumor cells often causing tumor *dormancy*
	- ##### Process of tropism
		- Tumor cell adhesion molecules may be preferentially expressed for certain target organs
		- Chemokines may help determine site of metastasis
		- Target tissue may be resistant to tumors(skeletal muscle, spleen)
