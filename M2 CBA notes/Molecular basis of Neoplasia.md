[[Neoplasia]]
==slides DONT DO DETAIL== lol
___

##### Mutations
Inheritable or acquired
split into

###### Point mutations(3,2)
More common in epithelium
- Substitution
- Insertion
- Deletion
Imp example
- RAS gene being converted into a cancer gene
- TP53 is the most common suppressor gene being affected
###### Gene rearrangements(4,1)
- Gene rearrangements(translocations, inversions)
	- Overexpression/formation of new gene
- Deletions
- Aneuploidy
- Amplification
Imp example
- Chronic myeloid leukemia
Philadelphia chromosome formation where reciprocal translocation occurs between chromosome 9 and 22
results in formation of BCR-ABL fusion gene

##### Effects of mutations
Cancer develops through a step-wide accumulation of mutations after a carcinogenic-induced mutation.
Mutations can be 
- Driver Mutations
- Passenger Mutations
Carcinogenic mutation->Driver mutation->Passenger mutation
The driver mutation keeps the cancerous cell alive, whereas the passenger mutation acts as a neutral gene being carried along.
This follows Darwinian selection, which is likely why cancers gradually become more aggressive and less responsive to therapy


## Genetic Hallmarks(8)


- ### Self-sufficiency in growth signals
	
  #### Oncogenes(3,1)
	Proto-oncogenes are growth-promoting genes liable to form a cancerous cell if a single allele mutates
	These primarily encode 
	- ##### transcription factors 
		- MYC protein(involved in Burkett lymphoma)
	- ##### pro-growth signaling pathways(growth factor/receptors, second messenger)
		- Growth factors
		- Growth factor receptors
		- HER2 important example for breast cancer
	- ##### Signal Transducer molecules
		- RAS
	- ##### Cell survival factors
	Any of which if affected increase the rate of cell-cycle progression
- ### Insensitivity to growth inhibitory signals
	- Tumor suppressor genes
	- RB gene: G1S governor
	Detects external damage/stresses to cells
	- TP53 gene: mutated in 90% of cancer cells. Recessive gene. G1S guardian.
	Detect nuclear defects, initiates repair/apoptosis. More important.

- ### Altered cellular metabolism
	- ###### Warburg Effect
		Growing cells utilize aerobic glycolysis
		Cancer cells get stuck in this energy production
		This can be detected via PET scans

- ### Evasion of apoptosis
	- ###### Genes regulating apoptosis
		-  Tumor suppressor TP53 mutation
		-  Overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL gene

- ### Limitless replicative potential
	Normally each cell is capable of 70 replications due to inactivation of telomerase.
	If TP53 is mutated
	Cells undergo non homologous end joining(NHEJ) instead
	Either a mitotic crisis occurs, or telomerase reactivates and produces a cancerous cell
 - ### Sustained angiogenesis
	Necessary for enlargement past 1-2 mm
	This is done via Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)
	Angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors are balanced
	- Hypoxic condition stabilizes HIF1Î±
	- Tumor suppressors + oncogenes
	- VEGF transcription from RAS-MAP kinase pathway
- ### [[Metastasis and local invasion]]
- ### Evasion of immune surveillance
		- Cancer cells express antigens that the immune system can act against
		- Despite the antigens, immune response is ineffective and can instead promote cancer growth
	- #### Tumor antigens
	 Passenger mutations accumulate and some qualities are common in most cancer cells
	 - Tyrosinase 
		 - Prevalent in melanomas
	- Cancer-testis antigens
		- Germ cell tumors
	- Oncogenic viral proteins
		- Certain viruses can cause cancer(HPV, EBV, etc.)
	- #### Immune response
		- Dead tumor cells phagocytosed, releasing damage-associated molecular patterns
		- Stimulates MHC 1 molecules
		- Recognition by CD8+ T cells which form Cytotoxic T cells
