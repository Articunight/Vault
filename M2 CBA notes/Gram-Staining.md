___
##### Principle
On the basis of permeability of cell wall
Gram + have thick cell wall with low lipid count and hold the basic dye and resist decolorization with acid alcohol
Gram - have thin cell wall with high lipid count and fail to hold the basic dye and freely decolorize
##### Method
1. Label slide
2. Make a thin smear of 1.5-2.0 cm diameter
3. Dry smear
4. Fixate smear to prevent washing out(either by heat or alcohol(only for gram - diplococci and M. Tuberculosis))
5. Staining
6. Microscopic examination
##### Reagents
- Basic dye
	- *Crystal violet* or Gention violet stain
- Mordant 
	- Lugol/*Gram iodine*
- Decolorizer 
	- Acetone
- Counter stain 
	- Safranin
##### Procedure
1. Place fixated slide on staining tray
2. Gently flood smear with *Crystal Violet* and let stand for 1 minute
3. Tilt slide and rinse with tap water
4. Repeat with *Gram's iodine*
5. Decolorize drop by drop with acetone while tilting the slide and(3-5 seconds )
6. Immediately wash away
7. Add counter-stain *Safranin* and tilt slide and wash away after 1 minute
8. Add 1-2 drops of cedar oil on slide
9. Watch on 40x objective to judge smear then 100x oil immersion lens

##### Precautions
Cell-wall damage due to excessive heat fixation or antibiotic therapy
Over decolorization of smar
Use of too old iodine solution
Use of old culture for smear preparation
Occasionally gram-negative organisms may not be decolorized fully and appear as gram + if smear is too thick
