Identification of weak points and breaking weakest link in chain of transmission is the basic approach

###### Disease control
Refers to all measures designed to prevent incidence prevalence and consequence of disease.
Part of Primary Healthcare(PHC)
- Community participation
- Political support
- Inter-sectoral coordination
###### Methods
- Reservoir or source of infections
- Route of transmission
- Susceptible host
###### Purpose
Treatment of patients
Epidemiological investigation
Descriptive epidemiology
Prevention and control measure
###### Notification
Important source of epidemiological information. Enables early detection of disease outbreaks
###### Certain diseases are notified to WHO
- Subject to IHR
	- Cholera
	- Plague
	- Yellow fever
- Diseases under surveillance
	- Louse borne typhus fever
	- Relapsing fever
	- Paralytic polio
	- Malaria
	- Viral influenza

###### Isolation
For the infected 
Up to 14 days
Separation of infected person for the period of communicability to prevent to limit the direct or indirect transmission of the infectious agent from those infected to those who are susceptible or may spread the agent to others
- Standard
- Strict
- Protective
- High-Security

###### Ring immunization
Achieved by encircling infected persons with a barrier of immune persons through which the infection is unable to spread
Period of isolation is determined by period of communicability and the effect of chemotherapy

###### Susceptible host
Active immunization(EPI)
Passive immunization
- Normal human Ig
- Specific human Ig
- Antisera(nonhuman) or antitoxin

###### Chemoprophylaxis
- Casual prophylaxis
	- Implies the complete prevention of infection by early elimination of invading or migrating casual agent
- Complex prophylaxis
